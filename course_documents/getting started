From My Summer ’17 work:
1.	Use internal sources
a.	content lists created by ORCA Curriculum working group AY ’16-’17 for each pillar and foundational area
b.	look at entire sequence of its pillar to best determine what goes where
c.	ORCA major outcomes and suggested ones from Summer ’16 work

2.	Use external sources
a.	Program review self-study curriculum outward look - similar programs and courses like this - and any new outward look at existing courses and programs.
b.	CAP and other sources from Summer ’16 work.
c.	External advisory body (CG, MOR, industry, academia …)*

Plus
-	See conclusion section of my sheet about Isaac’s blog in 2nd section of strat. plan binder – some good points to maybe get into the framework
-	See ‘Int. det. models course - resources & plans.docx’ – I’ll print it
