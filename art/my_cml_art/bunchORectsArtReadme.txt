i wrote the code that generated teh bunchorects100_goHome.png - thought it looked cool

so saved it as png

also saved the settings of the 100 random rects into the csv file

only problem is those are for the ending states

to reconstruct from beginning would need to scale them each up by 1/.9 20 times
that should work though might be off due to rounding - they may be more uniform
than what they started at, oh well

to create in the 1st place I did:
rs = bunchORects(100);goHome(rs)
